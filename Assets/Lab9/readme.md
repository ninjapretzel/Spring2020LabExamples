# Lab9
### V1
Simple UI that has 3 radio buttons, an input, and a button.

All of the UI controls are bound to callbacks on an instance of the provided `Lab9V1` script.

Inspect each object to see how they are wired up.

Any "simple" method can be called from the inspector events. "Simple" methods are ones that are public, non-static, and take either zero or one "Simple" parameters. A "Simple" parameter is then either a basic type (eg `int`, `float`, `string`), or a Unity-object reference (eg `GameObject`, `Transform`, `Rigidbody`).

### V2
I made a quick port/knockoff of a clicker game that can be found at:

You can hold left shift/control when clicking buy buttons to buy 10/100 at a time, respectively.
