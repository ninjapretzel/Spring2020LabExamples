### V1
Plain 2d version, just using a bunch of the physics joints and effectors.

There are a number of setups with various things (point effectors used as gravity wells, wheels with things attached, and two nearly identical setups to show the difference between spring and distance joints.

Note how the left ones (the springs) all bounce together, while the right ones (the distance joints) act a bit differently.

### V2
I rigged a model from a certain popular video game as a ragdoll, and make a bunch of them fall.

When running that demo, feel free to grab the boxes and move them. They have kinematic rigidbodies on them, so they will interact with and "wake up" the ragdolls when they collide with them.
